<h3 class="txt">Coronavirus has disrupted lives all over the world, and while we can sit comfortably in our homes to help contain the spread of the virus, there are a lot of people who are struggling to make ends meet. These organizations have set up relief funds to help those affected by the coronavirus. Your individual donations can make a difference.</h3>
<h3 class="txt">Your individual donations will help them provide basic ration and hygiene supply kits to the daily wagers, migrant workers, street children, single parents and beggars who are the worst hit due to the lockdown. The supply kits and packages include daily essentials like food grains, toiletries and basic medications.</h3>
